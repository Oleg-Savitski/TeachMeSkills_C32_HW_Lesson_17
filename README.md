Task 1.

 Create a generalized functional interface.
 Write a class with a single method.
In this method, implement the logic:

 - if the number 1 is entered into the console, then:
use the interface with a string type and pass the logic
of string reversal (output of the string in reverse order)
to the interface method.

-if the number 2 is entered into the console, then:
use the interface with an integer type and pass the logic
of finding the factorial of the number to the interface method.

Task 2.

Get the day of the week by date.
I used Zeller's algorithm.
My curiosity made me use this algorithm.
